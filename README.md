# Backtesting
*Udacity - AI for Trading Nanodegree Program*

## Project Overview
* Build a fairly realistic backtester that uses the Barra data. 
* The backtester will perform portfolio optimization that includes transaction costs, with computational efficiency in mind, to allow for a reasonably fast backtest. 
* Use performance attribution to identify the major drivers of the portfolio's profit-and-loss (PnL). 
* Modify and customize the backtest.
